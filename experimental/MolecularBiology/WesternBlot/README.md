### Pouring a gel *with* a stacking component (all recommended volumes are for a mini gel):
> *1.5mm thick gels hold approximately 10mL liquid. This will be divided into approximately 7mL resolving gel and 3mL stacking gel. We typically load run 10% resolving gels.*
1. Assemble the gel stand 
  <br> *(optional) Fill with dI water to ensure there are no leaks, then pour out water and wick away as much as possible with a Kimwipe.
  <br> (optional) Insert comb into the glass stand, and mark with a Sharpie where your wells end so you know how much resolving gel to add.*
2. Make 10mL resolving gel solution, according to the table above. Both acrylamide solution and 10% ammonium persulfate (APS) are stored in the Midtown refrigerator (B455). _**(Be sure to use Tris pH 8.8!)**_
3. Working quickly, add APS and TEMED. Close the tube and invert 3x to mix, then use a serological pipet to load 7-7.5mL solution to the glass chamber. *A good fill line is the bottom of the upper green plastic piece on the clamp holding the glass plates together, or 1/2 cm below the bottom of wells you marked).* 
4. Add 500uL isopropanol directly on top of the resolving gel. *This will ensure a flat interface between the stacking and resolving portions of the gel, and will also pop any bubbles that may have formed while pipetting)*. Save the leftover resolving gel to ensure it polymerizes.
5. Once the gel has polymerized (approximately 30 minutes), rinse the isopropanol out extensively using dI water. *Leftover isopropanol can interfere with the stacking-resolving interface.*
6. Make 4mL stacking gel solution _**(be sure to use Tris pH 6.8!)**_ and add on top of the resolving gel, again working quickly after addition of the APS and TEMED. *Adding bromophenol blue can be helpful to visualize the wells when loading the gel*. 
7. Insert the green comb, ensuring there are no bubbles present. *Slightly overfilling (so that the meniscus extends above the shorter glass plate) will help prevent bubbles.*
 
### Pouring a gel *without* a stacking component:
> *Sometimes when running a quick and dirty gel (informative but maybe not publication quality), pouring the stacking gel is not necessary – you will slightly decrease the clarity of bands, but will also save time.*
1. Follow the recipe for 15mL resolving gel
2. Fill the glass cassette entirely with resolving gel. 
3. Insert the green comb, and allow to polymerize for about 30 minutes.

## Running the gel
> *This protocol is written for a denaturing gel, some portions are not relevant to native gels.
<br> The Biorad Mini-Protean gel rig we have can cast and run up to four gels at once. 
<br> When running only 1-2 gels, you must use the gel holder than has an electrode pin.*

1. Assemble the gel running apparatus, **_ensuring that the shorter glass plate is facing towards the inside of the running chamber_**. 
2. Fill the running chamber with 1X Tris-Glycine buffer (with or without SDS, depending on denaturing or native gels. The stock running buffer we have contains SDS and is denaturing).
3. Protein ladders are kept in the Midtown (B455) freezer.
4. Mix each sample 1:1 with 2x loading buffer (2x Laemmeli buffer + DTT or BME) 
<br> *(optional) use 6x loading buffer, which will allow you to load more total protein* 
5. Boil samples at 95°C for 5 minutes to denature proteins and break up complexes. If using 1.7mL Eppendorf tubes, be sure to use cap holders or tubes could pop open and evaporate. If it’s available, a PCR machine is a great way of boiling your samples.
6. Load samples:
- 10 well, 1.5mm thick gels will hold <60uL
- 15 well, 1.5mm thick gels will hold <30uL
7. Run the gel. The following voltages should get close to running off the dye front, but every gel varies slightly so keep an eye on it.
- 100V for 2 hours 
- 150V for 1 hour 7 minutes
- 200V for just under 1 hour

## Staining the gel:
> *After the gel has run, it can be stained with SYPRO (ThermoFisher) to visualize total protein prior to transferring to a membrane. 5000x SYPRO Tangerine is in the Midtown (B455) freezer. (SYPRO isn’t great for low abundance proteins – it works great for detecting something overexpressed, but use the silver staining kit for anything low abundance that matters)*

## Transfer for western blotting:

### Transfer Buffer:
> *1x Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol. We purchase tris-glycine buffer as 10x stock. Be sure you do not use Tris-glycine-SDS buffer which is used for running, not transferring, acrylamide gels.
<br> There is a large stock of precut PVDF membrane and Whatman paper in the drawers under the bench.*
1. If transferring to PVDF, incubate precut membrane in 100% methanol for 5 minutes.
- *If using fluorescence to visualize proteins, transfer to Immobilon-FL.*
- *If probing small proteins (under 20kDa), transfer to Immobilon-PSQ.*
- *If using chemiluminescence, both membranes should work.*
2. Wash the gel well with dI water to remove excess SDS from the running buffer.
3. Submerge all components of the transfer sandwich (including the gel) in transfer buffer before assembly. 
4. Assemble the transfer sandwich according to the diagram below. Where the diagram says “filter papers”, place two layers of Whatman paper (precut into 9.5x7cm sheets). **_Make sure the gel is on the negative (black) side of the sandwich and the membrane is on the positive (red) side._** 
- *The Criterion transfer box we have can accommodate two gels per sandwich (side by side), and can fit two sandwiches at a time for a total of four transfers.* 
- *The Mini-Protean transfer box can fit one gel per sandwich, two sandwiches per transfer.*

5. Run the transfer at 100V/350mA for 1 hour. 
- *Should completely transfer proteins onto the membrane. For high molecular weight proteins or transferring from high percentage gels, increase the transfer time to 2 hours.*
- *The transfer will get very hot, and the vapor coming off contains methanol – be careful removing the sandwich after the run is complete!*
- *Cooling the transfer down will produce cleaner bands. The transfer can be cooled down by running for longer at a lower voltage, adding an ice pack (Midtown freezer), running the transfer in a cold room, placing the entire transfer tank on ice.*


## Blotting the membrane:
> *Running a gel and transferring it to a membrane should be relatively uniform for everyone in the lab, but the blotting protocols can vary greatly. This is a basic starting protocol, but you will have to optimize what works for your target proteins and antibodies.*
<br> *Antibodies are stored at 4oC and at -20oC. Locations and information can be found on the lab antibody database in the Google Drive:*
<br> */Google Drive/rinn_lab_boulder/Protocols/Boulder Lab Protocols/Protein gel and western blot protocol*


### Basic protocol:
> *Blocking Buffer:*
<br> *1x TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% powdered milk or 1-3% BSA.* 
<br> *Many companies have proprietary blocking buffers that decrease background, but milk and BSA are typically sufficient.*

1. After proteins have been transferred to the membrane, incubate the membrane in blocking buffer for 15 minutes at room temperature. Aspirate blocking buffer.
2. Add primary antibody solution. Unless better information is available, start with a 1:1000 dilution of the antibody in blocking buffer. 
3. Incubate overnight at 4oC. 
<br> *(optional) Incubate >1hr at room temp instead.*
4. Wash 3 x 5 minutes with TBST at room temperature.
5. Add secondary antibody solution. These typically can be used at a starting dilution of 1:5000 in blocking buffer, sometimes up to 1:100,000 and can also be reused. 
6. Incubate 1-2 hours at room temperature.
> *Antibody dilutions can typically be reused, so pipet off when the incubation is done rather than aspirating. If you are saving antibody dilutions, store at 4oC. (optional) Add 0.02% sodium azide.*
7. Wash 3 x 5 minutes with TBST at room temperature.
8. For chemiluminescent antibodies, add developer substrate according to kit specifications. 
9. Image the membrane.
- *Fluorescent antibodies can be imaged on the Parker lab Typhoon*
- *Chemiluminescent antibodies can be imaged on the Cech lab AlphaImager, or the LAS4000 (3rd floor by cell culture).*
