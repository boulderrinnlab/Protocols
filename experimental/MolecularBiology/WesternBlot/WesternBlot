Here I will go throuhg all the steps for western blotting in the lab

1) Thaw extracts on ice (about 20ul is loaded in total, good to make aliquots of ~32 ul)
2) Add 8ul 5X loading buffer, to 32ul of lystate > Boil 10 min (check caps afer)
- see if the size ladder needs boiling too

----------- Gel Set up ----------- 

1) Put gel with wells facing into the aparatus
**** Take off green strip from pre-cast gels **** you will regret it if you don't :)
2) Pour running buffer in the middle sectino to make sure not leaking
3) Load samples (~20-25ul max) and Ladder 10ul
4) Fill container with running buffer up to the marker with # of gels being run (max = 4)

5) Run @ constant 120V for 1- 1.5 hrs

----------- Transfer Set UP ----------- 

*** remove gel by cracking open on the sides in transfer buffer to get gel off plastic ***
*** cut off wells and dye running front *** Set up below:

1) Put transfer aparatus in ice bucket fill all around.
2) Clear side think of as red and the gel will "run to red"
-- Clear side to the left:
-- Soak all the following in this order in transfer buffer
-- activate membrane by soaking in water or transfer buffer
*** Sponge > 2x whatmann paper  > membrane > Gel > 2x whatmann paper > Sponge ***
-- use roller to remove any bubbles
-- place black side to black and clear to red side of transfer aparatus
3) Transfer @ 80V constant for 2.5 hrs

----------- Blocking and Antibody Addition -----------

*** When you remove the membrane from transfer buffer the upside is the side closest to gel ***
*** cut top right corner of membrane to know what the upside is moving forward ***

1) wash the membrane in water
2) Add Ponso stain 2-3 min - take picture
3) Return ponso to container -- can be reused many times
3) Wash Ponso off membrane with 3 quick washes
4) Block with ~10 ml of 5% Milk (2.5g + 50ml TBST)
5) Rotate for about 1hr on shaker (in plastic trays)
6) Prepare antibody dilution in 10ml of 5% milk
7) Add antibody 10ml mix on shaker 4hrs at RT or O/N @ 4C (cleaner)
 
----------- Washing and visualization -----------

1) Quick wash with TBST to remove milk
2) 3x 5 min TBST washes
3) Prepare secondary antibody in 5% milk to 10 ML
4) Incubate on shaker for 1hr
5) 3x 5 min TBST washes
6) Bring membrane to visualization machine on protective sleeve (clear cover sheets)
7) Prepare 750ul of ECL1 and 750ul ECL2 
8) Add 1.5 ML ECL mix to membrane
9) Dry by wicking with kim wipe
10) Visualize!
