pipette **ONLY** 350uL dH2O into the DNA or RNA cleaning chip
place cleaning chip into cartridge and close lid
wait 1 min
remove cleaning chip
leave lid open a few minutes to air dry pins
discard water and return cleaning chip to box

>*Starting material: up to 11 samples, 1uL each, 5 – 500 pg/µL, 50 – 7000 bp size range
For amplicon PCR products, load 1 uL of 0.25-0.5 ng/uL DNA*
### On the Priming Station, adjust the syringe clip to the _**lowest**_ position

### Preparing the Gel-Dye Mix

1. Allow High Sensitivity DNA dye concentrate (blue) and High Sensitivity DNA gel matrix (red) to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min.
2. Add 15 μL of High Sensitivity DNA dye concentrate (blue) to a High Sensitivity DNA gel matrix vial (300 uL in vial) (red).<br>
*(optional) just mix together the amount you will use within 6 weeks: need 36 uL final for each chip, so mix/filter ~50 uL per chip. Per chip, mix 2.5 uL uL dye (blue) with 50 uL red (gel)*.
3. Vortex solution well and spin down. Transfer to spin filter (included in kit box or stored in box on the shelf above the BioA computer).
4. Centrifuge at 2240 g ± 20 % for 15 min. Protect solution from light. **_Label tube with date._** 
5. Store remainder at 4°C. Use prepared gel-dye mix within 6 weeks of preparation.

### Loading the Gel-Dye Mix
1. Allow the gel-dye mix to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min before use.
2. Put a new High Sensitivity DNA chip on the chip priming station.<br>
*(optional) Pressure test chip/priming station seal before loading by positioning plunger at 1mL, closing priming station, and pressing plunger until held by clip (you should feel pressure). Release the clip (plunger should pop back up, at least to 0.5mL mark)*.
3. Pipette 9 μL of gel-dye mix in the well marked G (circle) (1 well).
4. Make sure that the plunger is positioned at 1 mL and then close the chip priming station.
5. Press plunger until it is held by the clip. (you should feel pressure)
6. Wait for exactly 60 s then release clip. (plunger should pop up, at least to 0.5mL mark)
7. Wait for 5 s, then slowly pull back the plunger to the 1 mL position.
8. Open the chip priming station and pipette 9 μL of gel-dye mix in the wells marked G (3 wells).

### Loading the Marker
1. Pipette 5 μL of marker (green) in all sample and ladder wells. Do not leave any wells empty (12 wells).
### Loading the Ladder and Samples
1. Pipette 1 μL of High Sensitivity DNA ladder (yellow) in the well marked with the ladder picture (1 well).
2. In each of the 11 sample wells pipette 1 μL of sample (used wells) or 1 μL of marker (unused wells) (11 wells).
3. Put the chip horizontally in the adapter and vortex for 1 min at the indicated setting (2400 rpm).
4. Run the chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument within 5 min.
### After run
1. Be sure to remove chip (discard used chip) and clean pins within 5 mins of run ending.
2. Turn off machine.

from Agilent
[https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/RNA-6000-Nano_QSG.pdf](url)
>*Starting material: up to 12 samples, 1uL each, 5 – 500 ng/µL*
On the Priming Station, adjust the syringe clip to the top position.

### Preparing the RNA Ladder
1. Spin the ladder down and pipette in an RNase-free vial.
2. Heat denature the ladder for 2 min at 70 °C.
3. Immediately cool the vial on ice.
4. Prepare aliquots in recommended 0.5 mL RNase-free vials with the required amount for typical daily use.
5. Store aliquots in -80 °C freezer, FISH room. After initial heat denaturation, the frozen aliquots should not require repeated heat denaturation.
6. Before use, thaw ladder aliquots on ice (avoid extensive warming).

### Preparing the Gel
1. Pipette 550 μL of RNA gel matrix (red) into a spin filter (or just the amount you will use within 4 weeks). Spin filters are included in kit box or stored in box on the shelf above the BioA computer.
2. Centrifuge at 1500g ± 20 % for 10 min at room temperature.
3. Aliquot 65 μL filtered gel into 0.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes. **_Label tube with date_**. Use filtered gel within 4 weeks. Store at 4 °C.

### Preparing the Gel-Dye Mix
1. Allow the RNA dye concentrate (blue) to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min.
2. Vortex RNA dye concentrate (blue) for 10 s, spin down and add 1 μL of dye into a 65 μL aliquot of filtered gel.
3. Vortex solution well. Spin tube at 13000g for 10 min at room temperature. Use prepared gel-dye mix within one day.

### Loading the Gel-Dye Mix
1. Put a new RNA chip on the chip priming station.<br> 
*(optional) Pressure test chip/priming station seal before loading by positioning plunger at 1mL, closing priming station, and pressing plunger until held by clip (you should feel pressure). Release the clip (plunger should pop back up, at least to 0.5mL mark)*.
2. Pipette 9 µL of gel-dye mix in the well marked G circle (1 well).

8. Discard the remaining gel-dye mix.

### Loading the Marker
1. Pipette 5 μL of RNA marker (green ) in all 12 sample wells and in the well marked with the ladder picture (13 wells).

### Loading the Ladder and Samples
1. Pipette 1 µL of prepared ladder in well marked with the ladder picture (1 well).
2. Pipette 1 µL of sample in each of the 12 sample wells. Pipette 1 µL of RNA Marker (green) in each unused sample well (12 wells)

## Notes: 
- Do NOT allow the computer to run automatic updates. Recent updates are not compatible with the 2100 software. 
- full manual and troubleshooting guide is available on the BioA computer
- data files are stored by date if you did not specify the path

## Analysis:
- sample names can be entered either before or after run
- print pdf report, select options, to save and transfer file
### for Illumina TruSeq RNA Libraries:
- analysis-global-smear analysis-region table and enter the 220-550 fragment size region
#### For each sample check: 
- % of total area of the fragment region. For a good library it should be >80% (optimal >90%)
- average fragment size. Should be ~340 and consistent across samples
### for Amplicon libraries (AMPure bead cleaned up)
- 1 sharp peak at expected size (product)
- 1-2 additional smaller peaks (primers) if not yet cleaned up

## Troubleshooting
- DNA chip – marker (upper or lower) is not recognized, or is recognized as the wrong peak, or program does not convert seconds to basepairs<br>
*can manually set either marker by right clicking on appropriate peak*
- DNA chip – upper marker is not complete or does not appear before sample time is up<br>
*can define far edge of electropherogram as peak, 
then manually set as upper marker<br>
request deep cleaning of the cartridge pins from EL or CM*
- DNA chip – high background and/or broad marker peaks<br>
*request deep cleaning of the cartridge pins from EL or CM*
- syringe does not pop up after priming<br>
*change syringe, small white gasket and black ring on priming station<br>
extra parts are stored on the shelf above the BioA computer, or ordered from Agilent #G2938-68716 (BioAnalyzer Gasket Kit for Chip Priming Station)*
- chip fails to run<br>
*likely bubble in the gel, start over*
- chip is not automatically recognized, or run will not initiate<br>
*2100 software issue, uninstall any recent computer updates*


## Examples – DNA HS chip
#### EZH2 MPRNA oligo pool
- ePCR (after AMPure bead cleanup) 250 pg <br>
*expect 226 bp ePCR product<br>*
- Amplicon library of ePCR (not yet cleaned up) 1 uL<br>
*expect 305 bp amplicon product, 58 bp and 80 bp primers<br>*
- Amplicon library of ePCR (after AMPure bead cleanup) 250 pg<br>
*expect 305 bp amplicon product<br>*
