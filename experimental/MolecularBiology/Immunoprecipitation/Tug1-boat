Protocol:

Cell lysis:
1.	Resuspend cell pellet in RIPA buffer (~1 mL per 10cm dish)
2.	Incubate on ice for 10-15 minutes
3.	Passage through 21 guage needle 5 times to further disrupt
4.	Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 10 minutes at 4ºC to remove particulate matter
5.	Transfer the lysate (the supernatant) to a fresh tube. Keep on ice.

Prepare the resin for pre-clearing:
1.	Wash 3x with lysis buffer. Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 20 seconds between the washes and discard the supernatant. 
2.	Prepare a 50% slurry by mixing equal volumes of resin and lysis buffer. Store at 4ºC and mix well before use.

Pre-clear lysate:
1.	Add 50 to 100 μL nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow suspension (50% slurry) to 1 mL cell lysate in an Eppendorf tube. 
2.	Gently mix for 1 hour at 4ºC. 
3.	Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 20 seconds. Save the supernatant.

Immunoprecipitation:
1.	Add 80 uL slurry Joan sent to 1 mL cell lysate
2.	Incubate with gentle rocking overnight at 4ºC
3.	Wash 3x with RIPA Buffer, spinning 12 000 × g for 20 seconds between washes and discarding the supernatants
4.	Wash 1x with Wash Buffer, then spin 12 000 × g for 20 seconds between washes and discarding the supernatants

Elution:
1.	Suspend the final pellet in 30 μL sample buffer. 
2.	Heat to 95ºC for 5 minutes. 
3.	Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 20 seconds to remove the beads. Carefully remove the supernatant. Analyze the supernatant by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot

Media preparation
nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow are supplied preswollen in 20% ethanol. Each medium must be thoroughly washed prior to use to remove the 20% ethanol storage solution. Residual ethanol may interfere with subsequent procedures.
You will need 50 µl of nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow or Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow 50% suspension per sample. Make sure that the beads are properly suspended before transferring.
1.	Gently shake the bottle of nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow or Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow to resuspend the medium.
2.	Use a pipette with a wide-bore tip to remove sufﬁcient slurry and transfer the slurry to an appropriate container/tube. If needed, cut the pipette tip to create a larger opening.
3.	Sediment the medium by centrifuging at 12 000 × g for 20 s. Carefully decant the supernatant.
4.	Wash the medium by adding 10 volumes of lysis buffer (see below). Invert to mix.
5.	Sediment the medium by centrifuging at 12 000 × g for 20 s. Decant the supernatant.
6.	Repeat steps 4 and 5 for a total of three washes.
For each ml of the original slurry of medium dispensed in step 2, add 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. This results in a 50% slurry. Store at 4º C and mix well before use.
Binding of the antigen
1.	Aliquot samples (500 µl) into new microcentrifuge tubes.
2.	Add polyclonal serum (0.5 to 5 µl), hybridoma tissue culture supernatant (5 to 100 µl), ascites ﬂuid (0.1 to 1 µl), or puriﬁed monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (add the volume corresponding to 1 to 5 µg). For controls, use non-immune antibodies that are as close to the speciﬁc antibody as possible (for example, polyclonal serum should be compared with normal serum from the same species).
3.	Gently mix for 1 h at 4ºC.
Precipitation of the immune complexes
1.	Add 50 µl nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow or Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow suspension (50% slurry).
2.	Gently mix for 1 h at 4ºC.
3.	Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 20 s and save the pellet (the beads).
4.	Wash the pellet three times with 1 ml lysis buffer and once with wash buffer. Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 20 s between each wash and carefully remove the supernatants.
Dissociation and analysis
1.	Suspend the ﬁnal pellet in 30 µl sample buffer.
2.	Heat to 95ºC and incubate for 3 min.
3.	Centrifuge at 12 000 × g for 20 s to remove the beads. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
4.	Add 1 µl 0.1% bromphenol blue to the supernatant.
5.	Analyze the supernatant by SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining, trypsin digestion, and analysis by mass spectrometry.
