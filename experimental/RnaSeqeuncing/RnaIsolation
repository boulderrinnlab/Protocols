This is a protocol for isolating RNA, DNAse Treatment and qPCR -- qRT-PCR from start to finish

1) RNA ISOLATION

~ 10^6 cells to 1ml of Trizol

a) Sit at room temp for 5 min.
b) Add 200 ul of chloroform -- vortex 15sec until pink cloud spins to top
c) Room temp 5 min
d) Spin at 4C for 15 min @ 12,000 G
e) Carefully pull the aqueous (clear) phase from the pink trizol
- don't touch white protein percipitate
- can get up to 600ul -- 400ul is safe
- put aqueous phase in 1.5 ml ependorf tube
g) Add equal volume of 70% ethanol (RNase free) 
h) Transfer up to 700 ul of etoh/aqueous to RNeasy spin column
i) Spin 8,000 G 15 seconds -- repeat with remaining etoh/aqueous
j) Add 700 ul RW1 (make sure already prepared!) to RNeasy column
** RW1 is toxic and needs to be disposed of in waste jar **
k) Sping 8,000G 15sec
l) Add 500 ul RPE (make sure already prepared from kit) spin 15 sec
m) REPEAT: Add 500 ul RPE (make sure already prepared from kit) spin 15 sec
n) quick spin to get remaining etoh off
n) PLACE COLUMN IN NEW ELUTE tube
o) Elute with 30-50 ul H2O -- make sure to pipette into middle of filter with out touching the filter.
p) Check concentration and 260/280 on nanodrop etc...


2) DNase
Our secret sauce is that Sigma makes a great buffer -- but Roche makes a better enzyme
So we get both kits and use the respective good parts

a) Add 1ug of RNA from above to DNase treatment

Reaction mix: Total volume 20 ul

| 10x Master | DNase I | RNase Inhibitor | RNA + H20 |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| 2ul        |  1ul    |      1ul        | 16ul total|
