# CRISPR/Cas9 Workflow:
1. Identify experimental goal (CRISPR_Overview)
2. Choose a method to express CRISPR/Cas9 components and decide whether to include selection markers (CRISPR_ExpressionSystems)
3. Design gRNAs and test for gRNA editing efficiency (CRISPR_gRNAs)
4. If creating a knock-in, design HDR template (CRISPR_HDRtemplates)
5. Transfect/transduce/electroporate cells and select (CRISPR_ExpressionSystems)
6. Clonal isolation and genotyping (CRISPR_ClonesAndGenotyping)
