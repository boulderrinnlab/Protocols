We are using Ampure beads or Kappa Pure beads. This protocol is being used with Ampure for now

** make fresh 80% etoh ~ 500 ul per sample

NOTE: The [salt] and [PEG] (polyethylene glycol) determines the size of DNA that can bind to the beads, not the [bead]


1) Bring 2ml Aliquot to room temp for 30 min 
  - can use rotator to help mix beads gently

2) Determine the exact volume of the sample you want to clean up
* if less than 50 ul dilute to 50 ul

3) Look at gel printout to determine amount of beads to add based on the desired size of DNA to be kept

4) Use 8 strip tube and 96 well plate magnet

5) Add volume of beads based on printout to tube

6) Pipette up and down ~10 times until really well mixed

7) Incubate at room temperature 15min to allow DNA to bind to beads

8) Put the tubes on the magnet for 10min

9) When beads have completely stuck to magnet, carefully pipette off supernatant making sure not to pipette beads
	** If beads end up in pipette, put supernatant back in tube and keep on magnet for 
  additional 2 min **
  
10) Make fresh 80% EtOH

11) Wash 2X with 80% etoh for 30 sec each
  * add 200 ul to beads on magnet 
  * DO NOT resuspend beads
  * carefully remove 200 ul and repeat one more time
  
12) Quick spin of 8 tube strip and place on magnet for 30 seconds

13) Dry for 3- 5 min until the beads look matte

14) While drying, use 10uL pipette to remove remaining EtOH
As the beads dry, they will turn a lighter brown, and may start cracking--do not allow too much cracking

15) Resuspend in 2uL more than will be removed so that beads are not pipetted with sample

16) Really resuspend the beads to break up clumps

17) Incubate at room temperature for 3-5min

18) Do a quick spin and move the tube back on magnet for 3-5min to collect beads

19) Remove the desired volume of eluted DNA being careful not to remove beads
