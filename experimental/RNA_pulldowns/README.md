## RNA Pulldowns

This document will provide brief descriptions of RNA pulldown methods performed in the lab, and help select the ideal pulldown for your system.

- *In vitro* pulldown
- Aptamer-tagged pulldown
- Antisense purification ([ChIRP](https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Magna-ChIRP-RNA-Interactome-Kit-Isolation-and-characterization-of-non-coding-RNAchromatin-complexes,MM_NF-17-10494))

The *in vitro* pulldown is the simplest - *in vitro* transcribe your RNA with biotinylated UTP, mix with cell lysate, pull down on streptavidin beads
Pros: simplicity
Cons: Doesn't always work, no endogenous RNP assembly machinery

The aptamer-tagged purification is more complicated, but more biologically relevant. Clone your RNA of interest with an RNA aptamer (S1, MS2, etc). Transfect, crosslink cells, pull down with appropriate beads
Pros: biological assembly of RNP
Cons: overexpression, aptamer tag may be influencing function, more time consuming

ChIRP is the gold standard (isolation of endogenous RNPs), but it's technically complicated
