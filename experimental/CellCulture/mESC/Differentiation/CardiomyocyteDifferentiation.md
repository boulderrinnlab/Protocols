# Mouse ES cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes

1. harvest mouse ES cells by trypsinization
2. resuspend cells in cardiac differentiation medium at 50,000 cells/ml
3. place drops of 20 µl (equals 1000 cells) onto the lid of a non-adhesive bacterial dish
4. fill dish with 2 x 5 ml of cardiac differentiation medium and invert lid with drops onto it
5. culture hanging drops for 2 days at 37°C and 5 - 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub>
6. collect embryoid bodies with 5 ml of cardiac differentiation medium and transfer to a non-adhesive bacterial dish and culture them in suspension for another 2-3 days
7. move the plate once or twice a day to avoid attachment of embryoid bodies
8. pick single embryoid bodies with a P20 and place them in the center of a gelatinized 24-well plate filled with 1 ml of cardiac differentiation medium
9. check cells daily for spontaneous contractile activity
