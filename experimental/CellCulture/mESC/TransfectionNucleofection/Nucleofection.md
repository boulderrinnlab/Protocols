# Nucleofection of mouse ES cells

### A. Prepare cells:

1. Feed mouse ES cells 4-12 h prior to transfection
2. Harvest cells by trypsinization
3. Spin cells down and resuspend in PBS
4. Count cells
5. Transfer 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells into an Eppendorf tube and spin down

### B. Prepare DNA:

1. Use the Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Nucleofector<sup>TM</sup> Kit (Lonza, VVPH-1001)
2. Prewarm supplemented Mouse ES Cell Nucleofector Solution (= 0.5 ml Supplement + 2.25 ml Nucleofector Solution, stable for 3 months at 4°C) to RT
3. Prepare Eppendorf tubes containing 8 µg of plasmid DNA in 10 µl supplemented Nucleofector solution

### C. Combine cells and DNA:

1. Resuspend cells in 90 µl supplemented Nucleofector solution per sample
2. Mix 90 µl cell suspension with 10 µl plasmid DNA by pipetting 3x up and down and transfer into a cuvette provided by the kit

### D. Nucleofect cells:

1. Insert cuvette into Nucleofector (Nucleofector<sup>TM</sup> 2b, Lonza, AAB-1001)
2. Select program **A-23**
3. Press ‘X’ button to start program
4. Display should show ‘OK’

### E. Plate cells:

1. Take cuvette and add 500 µl prewarmed culture medium
2. Transfer cells with plastic pipette supplied by the kit to 1-2 gelatinized (Millipore, ES-006-B) wells of a 6-well plate
3. Avoid transfer of pieces of precipitate!
4. Harvest cells after 24 h
