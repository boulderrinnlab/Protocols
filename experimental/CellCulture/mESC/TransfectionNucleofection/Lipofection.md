# Lipofection of mouse ES cells

### A. Prepare DNA-lipid complex (use 3 µl Lipofectamine per 1 µg DNA):

1. Dilute Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher, 11668019) in Opti-MEM medium (Thermo Fisher, 31985070)
- For 1-2 wells of a 6-well plate: 150 µl Opti-MEM + 24 µl Lipofectamine 2000 
- Incubate at RT for 5 min

2. Dilute plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM medium
-	For 1-2 wells of a 6-well plate: 150 µl Opti-MEM + 8 µg DNA

3. Combine diluted DNA and diluted Lipofectamine mixtures 
-	Allow complexes to form at RT for 15 min


### B. While complexes form, split and count cells


### C. Transfect mouse ES cells

1. Aliquot 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells into an Eppendorf tube
2. Add transfection solution and resuspend cells gently
3. Incubate in incubator for 10 min
4. Spin down cells **gently** and remove DNA-lipid solution
5. Resuspend in ESC medium and plate in 1-2 gelatinized (Millipore, ES-006-B) wells of a 6-well plate
6. Harvest cells after 24-48 h
